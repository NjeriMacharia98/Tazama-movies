## Description
I used the movie database API for all of the data and Firebase Authentication to give login functionality.Stored user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. I used Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework to save time styling .

## Project-Setup-Instructions
1)Installation of the Visual studio code .

2)Git cloning the repository .

## Technology-Used
HTML Was used as a primary language for the front-end. CSS styling was used to style the User Interface. JS - JavaScript is used to make the website interactive. vercel was used to host the content.

## Known-Bugs
The front-end is working properly. Yet to implement the backend.
